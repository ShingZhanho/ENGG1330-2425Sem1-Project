[Justification for Submitting a README.md instead of README.txt]

Although the README document is written in Markdown syntax, it is crafted in
a way that it can still be understood by human without Markdown rendering.
You can still read the source of the README.md without a Markdown viewer
as if the contents were written in README.txt.
